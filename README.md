# WebAirportFlightsApp
 - First, I need to mention that this project was not possible without my colleague's help, [**_George_**](https://github.com/AutumnBobcat161). <br />
 - We wanted to buid a web application capable of background server connectivity, database usage and delivering a simplistic, but ornanized graphical interface.

## Airport Events Scheduling (A.E.S.)
 - As mentined in the above subtitle, this is the name of the application. We focused on flights management system. Kinda like WizzAir (but way more minimalistic).
 - All its functions are detailed in the powerpoint presentation, but I am going to describe briefly some of the implemented actions.
 - Anyone can sign up, and then log in. Once logged in, your role is associated with "CUSTOMER", meaning that you can see all the available flights, filter them by your needs, and also book any flight you want.
 - More actors interract with the application: "ADMIN", "STAFF_MANAGER", "GUEST", "EVENT_MANAGER", each of them having different privileges and actions. (all of them, detailed in the presentation)

## Task Division
  - While George was working on the implementation of the dataBase and backend connectivity, I have focused on the frontend, the general aspect of the interface, the flow of application.
 
## Representative Image
 - All other pages are presented within "ApplicationScreenshots.docx" file.
